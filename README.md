- [Korean](README.ko.md)

## Overview

This project contains:

- Cloud Foundry VM setup tool (a.k.a `micro-cloud`)
- Cloud Foundry sample applications

## Setting up Cloud Foundry VM

### Prerequisite

- Download & Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) `4.2.10` or later (latest recommended)
- Download & Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) `1.1.5` or later (latest recommended)
- Make sure `host only network` in VirtualBox

### Installing Cloud Foundry

1. Clone this project.

		$ git clone http://github.com/frhwang/cf-demo
	
2. Boot up VM.

		cf-demo $ vagrant up
	
3. Login to VM via SSH

		cf-demo $ vagrant ssh
	
4. When you login to VM for the first time, Installation is perfomed automatically. Wait for completion of installing. It takes very long time. (1 hour+)

5. Finally, you may see following messages.

		Deployment Info
		***************
		* Status: Success
		* Config files: /home/vagrant/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox/config
		* Deployment name: devbox
		* Note:
		  * If you want to run ruby/vmc please source the profile /home/vagrant/.cloudfoundry_deployment_profile
		  * If you want to run cloudfoundry components by hand please source the profile /home/vagrant/.cloudfoundry_deployment_local
		* Command to run cloudfoundry: /home/vagrant/cloudfoundry/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start
		
		vagrant@micro-cloud $

6. Now you can run Cloud Foundry.

		vagrant@micro-cloud $ cf start
		
7. Check status for components of Cloud Foundry.
		
		vagrant@micro-cloud $ cf status
		Targeting deployment "devbox" with cloudfoundry home "/home/vagrant/cloudfoundry"

		health_manager                :	 RUNNING
		vblob_gateway                 :	 RUNNING
		router                        :	 RUNNING
		rabbitmq_node                 :	 RUNNING
		
8. `cf` command is alias for Cloud Foundry launch script. It has some commands:

		vagrant@micro-cloud $ cf start|stop|restart|tail|status

9. Add following entry to your hosts file (e.g. /etc/hosts) in the `host machine` (not VM)

		127.0.0.1 api.vcap.me uaa.vcap.me
		

### Verifying VM

All of following instructions must be performed in your `host machine`.

1. Install Ruby 1.9.2 (Recommended Installer: [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/))

2. Install RubyGems

3. Install VMC via RubyGems

		$ [sudo] gem install vmc

4. Register an account

		$ vmc target api.vcap.me
		$ vmc regster
	
5. Login to Cloud Foundry (installed in VM)

		$ vmc login
